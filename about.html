      <h1>[Why?]</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
        I created this website to showcase the Advent of Code community's creativity and problem-solving skills by
        highlighting a diverse range of solutions. While I’ve chosen to focus on more commonly used programming
        languages to make the site accessible to a wider audience, I acknowledge that this means some incredibly
        impressive solutions in esoteric or niche languages may not be included. This isn’t to downplay their brilliance
        but to strike a balance between accessibility and showcasing the breadth of the community’s work.

        So you found an issue with the website. Maybe some code is formatted incorrectly. Maybe I forgot to credit you
        for the code I've diaplayed. Maybe you found a bug. Anything it may be, feel free to raise an issue (or PR) on
        the <a href="https://github.com/tathyagarg/aoc-24" style="color: var(--color)">GitHub page</a>, I'll make sure
        to look into it!
