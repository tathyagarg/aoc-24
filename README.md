# Advent of Code

## A Humble Request
Please, don't vote on this project on the quality of the solutions. Vote on the aesthetic of the website. The purpose of this website is not to show the best solutions to the problems. It's to show how different people from the community write code and solve problems. To ensure I'm representing the community fairly, I'm doing no vetting. The code is copy pasted as-is from the source. 

This is a little website made to display the various solutions by the community to the problems from the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
